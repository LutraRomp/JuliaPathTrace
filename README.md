# JuliaPathTrace

Project to learn about raytracing.  Nothing polished.

I'm sort of organizing this project in a similar fashion to how
Julia packages are organized, but I don't yet have whetever
needs to be in place to tell Julia how to treat this as an
installable package.

The 'historical' directory contains an very early attempt at
writing a raytracer.

The 'src' directory contains the main codebase.
